## Methods and procedures
### Effective samples
- 148 American participants from MTurk.
- 161 Chinese participants from SoJump.
### Study Design
2 (culture) X 4 (face-alteration) mixed design.
- Culture: between-S factor
	- China
	- US
- face-alteration: within-S factor 
	- full-face (no alternation)
	- forehead-blocked (bandanna-added)
	- mouth-blocked (mask-added)

	??? add the four cartoon illustration
### Measures
Participants were presented with the following hypothetical task:
> We have filmed 20 different people displaying a smile. Some of the people are showing a real (genuine) smile whereas others are showing a fake smile. Imagine we had you watch these 20 short videos. After watching EACH video, you would have to judge whether the person in that video was showing a real (genuine) or a fake smile. Across all 20 videos, how accurate do you think you would be in each of the four circumstances below? On the scale: 1 = "I will be hardly better than random guessing." and 9 = "I will be perfect or almost perfect."
The four circumstances corresponds to the four levels of the face-alteration factor in the study design.
